# Worklog

A factual record of work done, checks performed and issues left open. Entries are appended, never
rewritten. Nothing is recorded here that did not actually happen.

## 2026-09-18 — Prompt [001](prompts/001-project-brief.md), project brief

**Instruction:** Organise the repository, document requirements, propose an implementation plan.
Do not implement the application. Review BlueCallom's Intelligence-over-Code method first.

**Performed by:** Claude, via Claude Code, under the project owner's direction.

### Work completed

1. Inspected the working directory. It was empty and was not a Git repository. Nothing existed to
   preserve.
2. Initialised a Git repository.
3. Reviewed BlueCallom's published material on the method:
   - <https://bluecallom.com/intelligence-over-code-method/> — retrieved successfully. Source of
     the "Prompt is King" hierarchy and the stated division between prompts and code.
   - <https://bluecallom.com/new-agentic-ai-framework/> — retrieved successfully. Source of the
     three-to-twenty prompts per agent figure, the Agentic Spin, and Human Interaction Points.
   - A web search was used to locate additional pages and to corroborate the statement that IoC
     is not no-code.
4. Created the documentation set: `README.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
   `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/worklog.md`, `docs/prompts/`.
5. Saved the project brief verbatim as
   [docs/prompts/001-project-brief.md](prompts/001-project-brief.md).
6. Added `.gitignore` covering Python, Node and environment files, so that `.env` cannot be
   committed once it exists.
7. Made the initial commit.

### Checks performed

- Confirmed the working directory was empty before initialising Git, so no existing work was at
  risk.
- Confirmed the saved brief in prompt 001 matches the instruction as received, with only a
  metadata header added above a horizontal rule.
- Confirmed every claim attributed to BlueCallom in `docs/requirements.md` section B traces to a
  page that was actually retrieved in this session, and recorded the source URL beside it.
- Confirmed `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and both dependency directories before committing.

No tests were run and no application code was written, because none exists. No functional
verification of any kind has taken place.

### Issues and observations

1. **One source page was unavailable.** `https://bluecallom.com/prompt-over-code-method/` returned
   HTTP 404 on direct retrieval, although it appears in search results under that URL. Its content
   was corroborated through search result extracts rather than direct retrieval. The material
   sourced this way is the "not no-code" statement in requirements B4. It is flagged here rather
   than presented as a verified direct quotation from a page we loaded.
2. **BlueCallom does not publish a development lifecycle.** The public pages give a philosophy and
   a component vocabulary, not a procedure, a prompt file format or a reference architecture.
   Everything at that level in this repository is our own choice and is labelled as such in
   requirements section C. This is stated so that no one later mistakes our conventions for
   BlueCallom's requirements.
3. **Eight decisions are open** and block the start of implementation. They are tabulated as D1
   to D8 in [requirements.md](requirements.md), section D. The two that most affect the shape of
   the code are D1, the model provider, and D4, offline mode.
4. **A design risk is recorded, not yet mitigated.** The characteristic failure of an
   Intelligence-over-Code project is a codebase that claims prompt primacy while business rules
   accumulate in Python conditionals. Acceptance criterion C7.1 exists as the test for this, and
   it cannot be exercised until code exists.
5. **Latency and cost are unestimated.** Five sequential model calls per session may be too slow
   for a comfortable demonstration. This will be measured once the pipeline runs. It has not been
   guessed at in the architecture document.

### Status at end of entry

Design documented. Implementation not started, as instructed. Awaiting the project owner's review
of the plan and answers to the open decisions.
